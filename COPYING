NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
------------------
All the Antiprism source code is supplied under a permissive licence.

The aim of using permissive licensing is to promote the development of
new polyhedron software by making it convenient to reuse the Antiprism
source code in other projects.

Please, support this aim. If you incorporate Antiprism source code
into your own project and make any improvements that could reasonably
be incorporated back into the Antiprism project, like bug fixes,
optimisations or new features, then please contribute your changes
for inclusion in back into Antiprism under a permissive (preferably
MIT) licence.
