NOTE TO DEVELOPERS

The Antiprism source is provided under permissive licences. The aim of
this is to promote the development of new polyhedron software by making
it convenient to reuse the Antiprism source in other projects. While not
required by the licences, if you make any improvements to the source
that could reasonably be incorporated back into Antiprism, like bug
fixes, optimisations or new features, then please contribute your
changes back for inclusion under the MIT Licence.
