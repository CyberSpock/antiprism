<h2>Working with Edges</h2>
The
<a href="off_format.html">OFF format</a> is generally used to
hold face and coordinate data. Using the OFF format to work with
edges is less well established. This is an overview of how
edges are managed within Antiprism.

<h3>What is an edge?</h3>

There are two ways that an edge can be read from an OFF file. The
two types are handled differently in the programs
<dl>
<dt><i>Explicit Edges</i>
<dd>These are set up from any OFF faces having exactly two vertices.
    Their colour is the OFF face colour.
    <p>
<dt><i>Implicit Edges</i>
<dd>These are extracted from all the OFF faces. They are the edges of
    the faces. Any pair of neighbouring vertices in an OFF face is
    considered an implicit edge. Implicit edges are coloured with the
    default colour.
</dl>

<h3>How are edges read and written?</h3>

When an Antiprism program reads an OFF file the two-vertex faces
are converted to edges - they are added to the edge list rather than
the face list. A particular program may then manipulate the edge list
and add implicit edges, or clear all the edges, etc.
<p>
When an Antiprism program writes an OFF file its current list of
edge elements is written out as two-vertex OFF faces, with their
colour if they have one. These will be interpreted as explicit edges
when the file is next read by an Antiprism program.
<p>
An edge joining any pair of vertices can only appear once in the
edge list. If the OFF input includes more than one two-vertex face
with the same vertices, in either order,
then the edge will have its colour overwritten.

<h3>How can edges be manipulated?</h3>

<i>off_color</i> colours edges. If the edge is not already in the
program's edge edge list it will be added. Otherwise, the new colour
will overwrite the old one. The colouring of explicit and
implicit edges can be controlled with <i>off_color -E</i>
<p>
<i>off_util -x e</i> will clear the edge list.
<p>
<i>off_util -x vf</i> will isolate the edge list. The faces section of
the OFF file output will contain only the edges.
<p>
<i>off_util -s</i> will make a skeleton. Edges not already in the
edge list will be coloured with the colour of an adjoining face, then
all the faces will be removed.



<h3>How do particular programs use edges?</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>Model programs: polygon, also named models</i>
<dd>These tend not to include edges in the OFF output. Edges can be added
    afterwards with <i>off_color -e</i>. However, some programs e.g.
    <i>lat_grid</i>, use edges to represent struts.
    <p>
<dt><i>Model programs that use another model as a base: poly_kscope, kcycle</i>
<dd>These tend to preserve edge elements in the output, if it
    is sensible to do so.
    <p>
<dt><i>Geometric transformation programs: off_trans, off_align</i>
<dd>These will preserve edge elements
    <p>
<dt><i>Antiview and most conversion programs: off2pov, off2vrml, off2m</i>
<dd>The default behaviour is to set up the explicit and implicit
    edges, and to use the explicit edge colours for any duplicated edges.
    <p>
    If the implicit faces aren't wanted then they can be hidden by
    colouring them transparent black with option <i>-E x</i>.
    <p>
    If only implicit faces are wanted then the two-vertex OFF faces
    can be stripped before using the conversion program. This can be
    done with <i>off_util -x e</i>.
    <p>
<dt><i>Reporting programs: off_report, off_query</i>
<dd>The default behaviour is to set up the explicit and implicit
    edges for the report or query. This can be changed with option
    <i>-E</i>
    <p>
<dt><i>Minmax, (and off2eig)</i>
<dd>These use edges as connecting elements. If there are any explicit
    edges then just these will be used. If there are no explicit
    edges then the implicit edges will be used.
    <p>
    If only implicit faces are wanted then the two-vertex OFF faces
    can be stripped with <i>off_util -x e</i>.
    <p>
    If both explicit and implicit edges are wanted then the implicit
    edges can be added in with <i>off_color -E i -e 0</i>
