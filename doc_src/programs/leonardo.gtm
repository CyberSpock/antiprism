Leonardo da Vinci style rhombicuboctahedron
<<CMDS_START>>
leonardo std_rhombicuboctahedron | antiview -v 0.02
<<CMDS_END>>

Leonardo da Vinci style rhombicuboctahedron, and hide edges that run
from the outside of the faces to the holes
<<CMDS_START>>
leonardo -x std_rhombicuboctahedron | antiview -v 0.02
<<CMDS_END>>

Leonardo da Vinci style rhombicuboctahedron, and thicken border and
use the same value for height
<<CMDS_START>>
leonardo -w 0.3 std_rhombicuboctahedron | antiview -v 0.02
<<CMDS_END>>

Leonardo da Vinci style rhombicuboctahedron, and thicken border and
use a smaller value for height
<<CMDS_START>>
leonardo -w 0.3 -l 0.05 std_rhombicuboctahedron | antiview -v 0.02
<<CMDS_END>>

Models use the colours from the base faces by default. In this
example a geodesic sphere dual has a proper colouring of its
faces and is then converted to Leonardo da Vinci style model
<<CMDS_START>>
off_color -f P geo_3_d -m map_orange:purple:white | leonardo -x | antiview -v 0.01
<<CMDS_END>>

Models can also use the colours from the base edges. In this
example a geodesic sphere dual has a proper colouring of its
edges and is then converted to Leonardo da Vinci style model using the
edge colours
<<CMDS_START>>
off_color -e P geo_3_d -m map_orange:purple:white | leonardo -e | antiview -v 0.01
<<CMDS_END>>

For non-orientable models, like the Mobius strip in this example, the
original faces must have the height equally distributed on each side so
that the units still meet correctly when the surface joins after being
flipped over
<<CMDS_START>>
unitile2d -s m -w 29 -l 2 | off_color -f P -m map_darkblue:white | leonardo -m -w 0.15 | antiview -v 0.02
<<CMDS_END>>

To make an image of a wooden model, create a file called <i>wood_faces.inc</i>
that contains these two lines
<pre>
   #include "textures.inc"
   #declare face_tex = texture { DMFWood4 scale 0.4 translate &lt;3,2,4&gt; };
</pre>

Now create the POV-Ray model with a command like this
<<CMDS_START>>
leonardo std_rhombicuboctahedron | off_trans -R 0,15,0 -R 15,0,0 | off2pov -i wood_faces.inc -x ev -B white &gt; wood_rhombicubo.pov

of Leonardo da Vinci's polyhedron illustrations.
<p>
In an oriented model based on an Antiprism resource model the new units
should generally have their outer side aligned with the original faces, and
the units will meet well on the visible outer surface. In the opposite
orientation the units will bind to the outside of the model, and will
not generally meet so well on their outer visible surface. If units do
not appear to be meeting well then try reorienting the model using
<i>off_util -O</i>. In the case of using -m, for non-orientable models,
neither of the new face unit surfaces coincide with the original faces
and reorienting the model will not help.
