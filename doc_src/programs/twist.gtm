<<NOTES_START>>
The twisted model is like a zig-zag tensegrity, but without the
zig-zag; the strut and its string loop lie on a plane.
<p>
An edge of a polyhedron has two vertices on the ends and is flanked
by two faces. In the dual these faces are associated with vertices,
and so an edge can be associated with four coordinates: two polyhedron
vertices and two dual vertices.
<p>
The other important point is the centre. This is the centre
of reciprocation used to find the dual.
<p>
An edge of a polyhedron can be associated, by the vertices
above, with an edge in the dual. The planes through these two
edges and the centre intersect in a line through the centre.
The centre of a twist edge, the same size as the polyhedron
edge can be put on this line and the twist edge rotated about
the line by t*90 degrees. Finally, the twist edge is translated
by the proportion <i>t</i> between the centre of the polyhedron edge
and the centre of the dual edge.
<p>
Finally, the twist edge segment is extended to see where it
intersects the planes through its edge neighbours, then the
extended edge is scaled (using the model centre) back to the
original size.
