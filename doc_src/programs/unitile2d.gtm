<<NOTES_START>>
This program is work in progress, and may change considerably in
future releases.
<p>
If a pattern doesn't mesh on a surface you may have to change options
-l or -w slightly. Pattern 7 won't mesh on any non-orientable surface.
Using values for option -T which are inappropriate for a particular
surface may cause the tiling not to mesh.
<p>
Some of the projective plane surfaces don't preserve the tiling as
they map a line of the tiling rectangle onto a single point of the
surface.
<p>
Unused options are silently ignored.
