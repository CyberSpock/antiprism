Notes for Antiprism 0.21.rc1
----------------------------

This is a minor release to provide fixes for problems found
in 0.20 and to distribute a couple of new programs.

Due to the extensive changes in the previous release, please
continue to be on the lookout for bugs or other issues and
report them to me at: adrian@antiprism.com

General
-------

Antiprism is a collection of programs for generating, manipulating,
transforming and viewing polyhedra

   http://www.antiprism.com/

This is a beta release. The programs have not had wide use
and probably contain a number of bugs. Please let me know
if you come across any bugs, or anything not working as
documented.

There are two release files.

   antiprism-0.xx.tar.gz       - source code
   antiprism-0.xx_install.exe  - Windows installer

In Windows, access to the resources may be optionally enabled by
setting the ANTIPRISM_DATA environment variable to the path of
the 'data' directory in the install directory. In a DOS box the
command would be something like

   set ANTIPRISM_DATA="c:\Program Files\antiprism\data"


Building
--------

These are instructions for building from source. They aren't
needed to run the Windows executables.

Antiprism uses the autotools build system. The programs can be
built with

   ./configure
   make

and installed with (as superuser)

   make install-strip

See the INSTALL file for more details.

If there are errors relating to shared libraries when the
installed programs are run, it may be necessary to run

   sudo ldconfig

The Antiview viewer depends on GLUT. A GLUT package suitable for
developing against must be installed in order to build Antiview,
otherwise the build and install will not include this program.

If building against a locally installed GLUT package, ensure that
the headers are in a GL subdirectory. If building against OpenGLUT
or Freeglut but using their own names for headers and libraries
(rather than the usual GLUT names) run configure with --with-openglut
or --with-freeglut.

Cygwin
------
run configure with "--with-x=no" to avoid building against X, if
it is installed. It should be possible to build native Windows
binaries by cross-compiling using the tools provided by Cygwin;
the -mno-cygwin option is not supported.


Git Code Repository
-------------------

The Git repository contains the latest development code

   https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=176443

See README.git for further details.


Note to developers
------------------
All the Antiprism source code is supplied under a permissive licence.

The aim of using permissive licensing is to promote the development of
new polyhedron software by making it convenient to reuse the Antiprism
source code in other projects.

Please, support this aim. If you incorporate Antiprism source code
into your own project and make any improvements that could reasonably
be incorporated back into the Antiprism project, like bug fixes,
optimisations or new features, then please contribute your changes
for inclusion back into Antiprism under a permissive (preferably
MIT) licence.
