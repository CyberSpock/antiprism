Notes for Antiprism 0.20
------------------------

This release include new programs, new features and many
changes to existing programs. A summary of changes is
included in the NEWS file.

New features include: a large collection of resource models,
accessible by name; symmetry operations for several programs;
the Antiprism C++ library is installed with headers and
documention and may be developed against (this is work in
progress); a self-extracting installer is provided for the
Windows binary package.

Due to the extensive changes for this release, please be on
the lookout for bugs or other issues and report them to me
at: adrian@antiprism.com

General
-------

Antiprism is a collection of programs for generating, manipulating,
transforming and viewing polyhedra

   http://www.antiprism.com/

This is a beta release. The programs have not had wide use
and probably contain a number of bugs. Please let me know
if you come across any bugs, or anything not working as
documented.

There are two release files.

   antiprism-0.xx.tar.gz       - source code
   antiprism-0.xx_install.exe  - Windows installer

In Windows, access to the resources may be optionally enabled by
setting the ANTIPRISM_DATA environment variable to the path of
the 'data' directory in the install directory. In a DOS box the
command would be something like

   set ANTIPRISM_DATA="c:\Program Files\antiprism\data"


Building
--------

These are instructions for building from source. They aren't
needed to run the Windows executables.

Antiprism uses the autotools build system. The programs can be
built with

   ./configure
   make

and installed with (as superuser)

   make install-strip

See the INSTALL file for more details.

If there are errors relating to shared libraries when the
installed programs are run, it may be necessary to run

   sudo ldconfig

The Antiview viewer depends on GLUT. A GLUT package suitable for
developing against must be installed in order to build Antiview.
If building against a locally installed Glut package, ensure that
the headers are in a GL subdirectory.

Cygwin
------
run configure with "--with-x=no" to avoid building against X, if
it is installed. It should be possible to build native Windows
binaries by cross-compiling using the tools provided by Cygwin;
the -mno-cygwin option is not supported.


Git Code Repository
-------------------

The Git repository contains the latest development code

   https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=176443

Autoconf 2.61 and Automake 1.9 (or later versions) are required.
Generate the configure script with

   ./bootstrap

Building the documentation is optional. Doxygen (with Graphviz dot),
Perl and help2man, are required. Build with

   make prepare_release

Follow the 'Building' section to complete the build.
