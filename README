Antiprism
=========

Notes for Antiprism 0.20.pre14
------------------------------

This release makes the Antiprism library available to C++
developers and Python developers (Python interface currently
disabled), and includes an installer for Windows.

In order to make the interface consistent there have been many
changes to the core code. This must therefore be considered an
UNSTABLE release.

Please report any bugs.


General
-------

Antiprism is a collection of programs for generating, manipulating,
transforming and viewing polyhedra

   http://www.antiprism.com/

This is a beta release. The programs have not had wide use
and probably contain a number of bugs. Please let me know
if you come across any bugs, or anything not working as
documented.

There are two release files.

   antiprism-0.xx.tar.gz       - source code
   antiprism-0.xx_install.exe  - Windows installer

In Windows, access to the resources may be optionally enabled by
setting the ANTIPRISM_DATA environment variable to the path of
the 'data' directory in the install directory. In a DOS box the
command would be something like

   set ANTIPRISM_DATA="c:\Program Files\antiprism\data"


Building
--------

These are instructions for building from source. They aren't
needed to run the Windows executables.

Antiprism uses the autotools build system. The programs can be
built with

   ./configure
   make

and installed with (as superuser)

   make install-strip

See the INSTALL file for more details.

The Antiview viewer depends on GLUT. A GLUT package suitable for
developing against must be installed in order to build Antiview.
If building against a locally installed Glut package, ensure that
the headers are in a GL subdirectory.

Cygwin
------
run configure with "--with-x=no" to avoid building against X, if
it is installed. It should be possible to build native Windows
binaries by cross-compiling using the tools provided by Cygwin;
the -mno-compiler option is not supported.


Git Code Repository
-------------------

The Git repository contains the latest development code

   https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=176443

Autoconf 2.61 and Automake 1.9 (or later versions) are required.
Generate the configure script with

   ./bootstrap

Building the documentation is optional. Doxygen (with Graphviz dot)
and Perl, are required. Build with

   make prepare_release

Follow the 'Building' section to complete the build.
