Antiprism
=========

Notes for Antiprism 0.20.pre12
------------------------------

This release makes the Antiprism library available to C++
developers and Python developers.

In order to make the interface consistent there have been many
changes to the core code. This must therefore be considered an
UNSTABLE realease.

Please report any bugs.


General
-------

Antiprism is a collection of programs for generating, manipulating,
transforming and viewing polyhedra

   http://www.antiprism.com/

This is a beta release. The programs have not had wide use
and probably contain a number of bugs. Please let me know
if you come across any bugs, or anything not working as
documented.

There are two release files.

   antiprism-0.xx.tar.gz   - source code only
   antiprism-0.xx-win.zip  - source code and Windows executables

The Windows executables are in the bin directory, and do not need
to be installed. To access the resources, set the ANTIPRISM_DATA
environment variable to the path of the 'share' directory. In a
DOS box the command would be something like

   set ANTIPRISM_DATA="c:\some\dir\antiprism-0.xx\share"


Building
--------

These are instructions for building from source. They aren't
needed to run the Windows executables.

Antiprism uses the autotools build system. The programs can be
built with

   ./configure
   make

and installed with (as superuser)

   make install-strip

See the INSTALL file for more details.

The Antiview viewer depends on GLUT. A GLUT package suitable for
developing against must be installed in order to build Antiview.


Git Code Repository
-------------------

The Git repository contains the latest development code

   https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=176443

Autoconf 2.61 and Automake 1.9 (or later versions) are required.
Generate the configure script with

   ./bootstrap

Building the documentation is optional. Doxygen (with Graphviz dot)
and Perl, are required. Build with

   make prepare_release

Follow the 'Building' section to complete the build.
