.SH NAME
rotegrity - make rotegrity models
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotegrity
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format containing a roughly spherical polyhedron, or
previously twisted model, and try to convert into a rotegrity. Units
keep original edge colours. If input_file is not given the program reads
from standard input.

.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.HP
\fB\-a\fR <type> model type: rotegrity, nexorade, for nexorade followed
.IP
by an optional comma and strut length
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <frac> fraction of length for end sections (default: 1/3)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
input model is already twisted (produced by this program or
\&'twist' program)
.HP
\fB\-M\fR <mthd> method of conversion from base model \- twist, double, joined,
.IP
or X (default: t)
.HP
\fB\-O\fR <type> output type for units: full (face), rotegrity (3 short struts),
.IP
nexorade (long strut), Nexorade (long strut, direction vertices)
(default: full). Only 'full' output can
be used as input with option \fB\-t\fR
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: rand), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef').
.HP
\fB\-c\fR <type> colouring type: edge (base model edges), symmetry, unit
.IP
(according to shape), none (default: edge)
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <itrs> number of iterations (default 10000)
.HP
\fB\-s\fR <perc> percentage to adjust corrections on iteration (default: 98)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR <lim>
minimum change of vertex distance to terminate, as negative
exponent (default: 15 giving 1e\-15)
.TP
\fB\-z\fR <n>
status checking and reporting every n iterations, \fB\-1\fR for no
status (default: 1000)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
quiet, do not print status messages
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
reproduce output of former 'twist' program (see Notes), \fB\-f\fR is
twist factor, \fB\-O\fR is output type, unused options silently ignored
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
