.SH NAME
wythoff - Wythoff-style constructions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wythoff
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format and apply a specified pattern to generate polygon
tiles. The polyhedron faces are divided by a 'meta' operation into triangles
each having vertices which are a vertex V, edge centre E and face centre F.
A start point is positioned on one of these triangles, the next point is
found by using the pattern to step between triangles, leading to a circuit.
If input_file is not given the program reads from standard input.

pattern in form: [Coords0:Coords1:...]Path0,Path1...
Coordinates are barycentric, in form VaEbFc:
.IP
VEF element letters, and a,b,c are barycentric coordinates
corresponding to the preceding element letter. Ommiting a
an element letter and coordinate sets the coordinate to zero.
Ommitting just the coordinate sets the coordinate to 1. E.g
.IP
V = (1,0,0), VE = (1,1,0), VE2F3 = (1,2,3)
Paths are in the form: TrisPidx0Move0Pidx1Move1...
.IP
Tris: one of +\-* (default +) indicating that paths should
.IP
start for positive, negative or both kinds of triangles.
.IP
Pidx: an index number of a point from the coordinates list
Move: an operation for stepping to the next triangle, given
.IP
as a series of characters from the following:
.TP
_
\- no move, stay on the same triangle
.IP
v,e,f \- step over side opposite V,E,F
V,E,F \- step two trianglesi, rotating about V,E,F,
.IP
according to: V=ef, E=fv, F=ve
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <op>
Conway polyhedron notation operator, or 'list' to list all
available operators with their corresponding patterns
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
relabel pattern, exactly three letters VEF written in any order
e.g. EFV relabels the pattern as V\->E,v\->e,E\->F,e\->f,F\->V,f\->v

input geometry is a 'meta' tiling, don't apply meta operation
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
tiles are coloured by index number (default, colour by value)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
output only one example of each type of tile (one per path)
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
add the 'meta'\-transformed base
.TP
\fB\-f\fR <ht>

.TP
\fB\-q\fR
quiet, don't print report
