.SH NAME
jitterbug - jitterbug transformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jitterbug
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcycle_stage\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a stage of the jitterbug transformation in OFF format. The
cycles run from 0.0 to 1.0. The fractional part of cycle_stage
is tied to a stage in a full rotation jitterbug. This stage is
measured by the distance travelled by a point moving around a square
which halves a cube of edge 0.25, and which determines the jitterbug
shape.
