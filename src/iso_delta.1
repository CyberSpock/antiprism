.SH NAME
iso_delta - isohedral deltahedra
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iso_delta
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,polyhedron\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Make Isohedral Deltahedra in OFF format. The polyhedron may be specified
by its list number, or the (start of the) name of the polyhedron.
Additional examples can be generated using \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-c\fR paramters.
Based on a paper by G. C. Shephard
Periodica Mathematica Hungarica, Volume 39, Numbers 1\-3, 2000 , pp. 83\-106(24).
