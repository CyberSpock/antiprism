.SH NAME
minmax - optimal spherical tesselations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minmax
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIinput_file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format containing a graph of a polyhedron, with or
without vertex coordinates, and try to create a spherical or ellipsoidal
tesselation where the maximum edge is a minimum length. If input_file is
not given the program reads from standard input.
