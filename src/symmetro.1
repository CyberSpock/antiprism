.SH SYNOPSIS
.B symmetro
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is inspired by a study done by Craig S. Kaplan and George W. Hart
(http://www.georgehart.com). Project information can be found at
http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/projects/symmetrohedra
.PP
Symmetrohedra are created by placing equilateral polygons centered on the
symmetry axes of Icosahedral, Octahedral, or Tetrahedral symmetry. The number of
sides of the polygons will be a multiple number of the axis reflection number.
Axes are in order as 0, 1 and 2 corresponding to icosahedral {5,3,2},
octahedral {4,3,2}, or tetrahedral {3,3,2}. Only two multipliers may be given.
.PP
It is possible to generate models such that the polygons intersect. If a
collision is detected, convex hull will be suppressed

icosahedral {5,3,2}, octahedral {4,3,2}, or tetrahedral {3,3,2}
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <vals> multipliers for axis polygons. Given as three integers
.IP
separated by commas. One multiplier must be 0. e.g. 2,3,0
.HP
\fB\-n\fR <frac> Or enter values as three comma delimited n/d values. n much be a
.IP
multple of p. One value of n must be 0. e.g. 5/2,3/1,0
Convex hull is supressed if a value of d is greater than 1
note: \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-m\fR are mutually exclusive options
.TP
\fB\-r\fR <v,n>
A value v, which is an amount of rotation given to polygon. The
.IP
value is degrees. If radians is desired enter as 'rad(v)'
or give a face rotation type: vertex=0, edge=1  (default: 0)
applied to optional axis n. if not given, implies first axis
.TP
\fB\-S\fR <s,n>
scale s of axis n polygon. if n is not specified, implies first axis
.IP
