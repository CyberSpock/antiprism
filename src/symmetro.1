.SH SYNOPSIS
.B symmetro
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is derived from a program written by Craig S. Kaplan
and George W. Hart (http://www.georgehart.com). Project information
can be found at http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/projects/symmetrohedra
.PP
Symmetrohedra are created by placing equilateral polygons centered on
the symmetry axes of Icosahedral, Octahedral, or Tetrahedral symmetry.
The number of sides of the polygons will be a multiple number of the
axis reflection number. Axes are in order as 0, 1 and 2 corresponding
to icosahedral {5,3,2}, octahedral {4,3,2}, or tetrahedral {3,3,2}
The end result vertices are all 1 unit from the polyhedron center. Note
that when all three multipliers are used there will generally be no
solution. In general, it is better to specify only two multipliers
.PP
These types of polyhedra will either have all polygons touching on edge
or all on vertices. In a case where a vertex meets an edge, a warning
will be displayed and the model will be generated. In this case, convex
hull will be suppressed. Try using \fB\-r\fR to rotate the polygons to possible
valid combinations. It is also possible to size polygons such that they
intersect. If a collision is detected, convex hull will be suppressed
