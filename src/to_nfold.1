.SH NAME
to_nfold - change the rotational symmetry of a polyhedron
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B to_nfold
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,fraction \/\fR[\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Generalise an axial model by changing its rotational symmetry. Read a model,
in OFF format, with an m\-fold rotational axis on the z\-axis, and create a
new model, generally non\-planar, with the same relative connections, but
with an n\-fold axis instead. fraction is given as n, or n/d (n and d
integers). Vertices of a face originally separated by x/m of a turn around
the z\-axis will be separated by xd/n of a turn in the final model. If
input_file is not given the program reads from standard input. to_nfold is based
on an idea by Bruce R. Gilson.
